    "text": "The Undergraduate Forestry Data Science (or, as we lovingly call it: “UFDS”) program is a joint collaboration between the US Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station, Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA), Bucknell University, and Reed College that engages undergraduate students with authentically motivated research questions in statistics, data science, and forestry. The co-directors of the program are George Gaines (FIA), Kelly McConville (Bucknell), and Grayson White (Reed). In summer 2026, the UFDS program will be held at Reed College, but in the past the program has taken place at Whitman College, Swarthmore College, Reed College, Harvard University, and Bucknell University.\nFIA is responsible for monitoring the status and trends in forested ecosystems throughout the US. As part of UFDS, students work on research questions generated by the FIA program and collaborate directly with research statisticians and foresters at FIA. With the rise of new data sources, such as satellite imagery and large scale photography, and with the explosion of new statistical learning tools, a wealth of estimation techniques are available to consider. But with these new methods also come a load of important statistical questions related to robustness, bias, efficiency, and more!\nHere’s a rough timeline of the summer research process:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should I spend my summer conducting research?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have so many answers that one of us even wrote a whole article about this question! Here’s the shortened version:\n\nLearning by doing data science: Practicing data science can really help you develop as a data scientist.\nCommunication skills: You will have multiple opportunities to share your work (both in writing and orally) to your peers, your mentors, the stakeholders, and novices. You will receive feedback to help you hone your communication skills.\nProfessional identity and belonging: Research can help strengthen your connection to the discipline of statistics.\nGraduate school and career preparation/clarity: The experience will demystify what research is and help you decide if you want to pursue an advanced degree. Plus, grad school or not, the tools and skills learned will help prepare you for your professional life after undergrad.\nAnd, it is fun: The data are messy! The questions are vague! The answers are unknown! What more could you want?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill I get to co-author a publication as part of this research opportunity?\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the start of a project, it is very difficult to predict whether or not it will result in a publication. And, for some projects, a journal article may not be the most useful final product. So, there is no certainty about whether or not your work will be published, but there will be many ways to share your work. For example, the group will present their findings to FIA researchers and will be expected to participate in any relevant campus research presentation events. We will also strongly encourage you to submit the final technical report to the Undergraduate Statistics Research Project Competition and/or a video presentation to the Electronic Undergraduate Statistics Research Conference (eUSR). One of the 2022 projects won “Best Video Presentation” at this year’s eUSR! On top of all that, we will also look for relevant statistics and data science conferences for you to share the work.\nDeliverables from previous projects have included journal articles, peer-reviewed technical reports, dashboards, and software development (links include an example of each).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat will a typical day look like?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe work will be highly collaborative. We will start most days with a team meeting where everyone presents their progress, discusses issues, and talks through their next steps. For the rest of the day, your time will likely be split between your projects and will be a mix of coding, writing, problem-solving, and dealing with merge conflicts in GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat software will we use?\n\n\n\n\n\nAll our work will be done using R/RStudio and git/GitHub. Previous experience with R is strongly recommended but previous experience with git is not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat prior coursework is required?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe projects will vary in terms of the computational and statistical skills needed, but each research fellow should have prior experience coding in R and building statistical models. Useful courses to have taken include an intro stats course, a coding course, and a modeling course. If you haven’t taken these sorts of courses, you are still encouraged to apply but should address your level of proficiency in R and your experience with statistical modeling in your application. If you don’t have prior experience in R but can code in another language (such as Python), make sure to mention this in your application. Those who are new to R will be expected to learn and use R during UFDS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to be a statistics or computer science major to apply?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo! While some of the former UFDS students have been statistics majors, others have majored in other disciplines such as Economics or English. Coming from a different field often brings a very valuable and unique perspective!\n\n\n\n\nTree art!\nDuring the summer of 2022, one of our research students, Jing Shang, created an artistic rendering of every team member’s favorite tree."

    "text": "Potential Projects\nOver the ten week period, students will work on approximately two projects in small groups. The overarching theme of the projects will be the development, evaluation, and distribution of statistical methods and tools for improving estimation of forest attributes. However, individual projects will vary from exploratory analyses to methodology comparisons to software and dashboard development. A few potential projects are listed below:\n\nIn recent years, FIA has experienced greater need for estimates of forest parameters over smaller geographic regions. For example, the Forest Service manages wild fires and tries to estimate the impact of these fires on important forest attributes. This area of research is called small area estimation. This project will explore the utility of several different estimators for estimating forest attributes over small areas.\nThe Forest Service is interested in using Bayesian statistics, a sub-field of statistics, and models to operationalize small area estimation, but they need guidance on the mechanics of fitting these models. This project will first learn about, and then write a tutorial on, operationalizing Bayesian small area estimation for the forest service and in forest inventory settings more generally.\nSimulation studies are crucial for understanding the properties of model-based estimators. And recently, the Forest Service has been interested in assessing estimators that account for change in the forest (from, e.g., a forest fire or clearcut). In this project, students will adapt the KBAABB methodology to help assess estimators that estimate change."
