# Overview

Students will work on problems generated by the US Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) and will collaborate directly with Research Statisticians and Foresters at FIA. FIA is responsible for monitoring the status and trends in forested ecosystems throughout the US. With the rise of new data sources, such as satellite imagery and large scale photography, and with the explosion of new statistical learning tools, a wealth of estimation techniques are available to consider. But with these new methods also come a load of important statistical questions related to robustness, bias, efficiency, and more!

Over the eight week period, students will work on approximately two projects in groups of 1-3. The overarching theme of the projects will be the development, evaluation, and distribution of statistical methods and tools for improving estimation of forest attributes. However, individual projects will vary from exploratory analyses to methodology comparisons to software and dashboard development. Here’s a rough timeline of the summer research process:

The bottom block spans the whole timeline and says 'Debugging Code' The second row up is broken into 4 roughly equal blocks which say from right to left 'Writing', 'Exec Summary', 'Writing', and 'Tech Report'. The third row has one block positioned between Jun 15 and July 30th which says 'Modeling, simulationg, and/or generating results'. The fourth row is broken into two chunks, the first sits in the first half of June and says 'Exploring, wrangling, and visualizing the data'. The second sits in the last week and say 'Creating beautiful graphs'. The fifth row is broken into three blocks. The first sits at the beginning in June and says 'Understand the problem.' The second sits detached in the middle of the row around July 1 and says 'Reunderstanding the problem'. The third sits at the end of the row around July 15th and says 'Finally Actually understanding the problem'."

# FAQs

## Why should I spend my summer conducting research?

I have so many answers that I wrote a whole article about this question! Here’s the shortened version:

* Learning by doing data science: Practicing data science can really help you develop as a data scientist.

* Communication skills: You will have multiple opportunities to share your work (both in writing and orally) to your peers, your mentor (me!), the stakeholders, and novices. I will give you feedback to help you hone your communication skills.

* Professional identity and belonging: Research can help strengthen your connection to the discipline of statistics.

* Graduate school and career preparation/clarity: The experience will demystify what research is, helping you decide if you want to pursue an advanced degree. And, grad school or not, the tools and skills learned will help prepare you for your professional life after undergrad.

* And, it is fun: The data are messy! The questions are vague! The answers are unknown! What more could you want?

## Will I get to co-author a publication as part of this research opportunity?

At the start of a project, it is very difficult to predict whether or not it will result in a publication. And, for some projects, a journal article may not be the most useful final product. So, I can’t say with any certainty whether or not your work will be published but I can say that we will find ways for you to share the work. For example, the group will present their findings to FIA researchers and will be expected to participate in any relevant campus research presentation events. I will also strongly encourage you to submit the final technical report to the Undergraduate Statistics Research Project Competition and/or a video presentation to the Electronic Undergraduate Statistics Research Conference (eUSR). One of the 2022 projects won “Best Video Presentation” at this year’s eUSR! On top of all that, we will also look for relevant statistics and data science conferences for you to share the work.

Deliverables from previous projects have included journal articles, peer-reviewed technical reports, dashboards, and software development (links include an example of each).

## What will a typical day look like?

The work will be highly collaborative. Three to four days a week we will have a team meeting in the morning where everyone presents their progress, discusses issues, and talks through their next steps. For the rest of the day, your time will likely be split between your two projects and will be a mix of coding, writing, problem-solving, and dealing with merge conflicts in GitHub.

## What software will we use?

All our work will be done using R/RStudio and git/GitHub. Previous experience with R is required but previous experience with git is not.

## What prior coursework is required?

The projects will vary in terms of the computational and statistical skills needed but each research fellow should have prior experience coding in R and building statistical models. Useful courses to have taken include an intro stats course (such as one of MATH 216, MATH 227, ANOP 102, PSYC 215, or ENGR 226), a coding course (such as one of MATH 230, CSCI 203 or ANOP 203), and a modeling course (such as one of MATH 217, CSCI 349, ANOP 330, or MECH 484). If you haven’t taken these courses, you are still encouraged to apply but should address your level of proficiency in R and your experience with statistical modeling in your application. If you don’t have prior experience in R but can code in another language (such as Python), make sure to mention this in your application.

## Do I need to be a statistics or computer science major to apply?

No! While some of my research students have been statistics majors, others have majored in other disciplines such as Economics or English. Coming from a different field often brings a very valuable and unique perspective!
